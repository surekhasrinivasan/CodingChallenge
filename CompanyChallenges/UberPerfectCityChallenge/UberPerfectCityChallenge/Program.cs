    /* Consider a city where the streets are perfectly laid out to form an infinite square grid. 
     * In this city finding the shortest path between two given points (an origin and a destination) is much easier than in 
     * other more complex cities. As a new Uber developer, you are tasked to create an algorithm that does this calculation.
     * Given user's departure and destination coordinates, each of them located on some street, find the length of the shortest 
     * route between them assuming that cars can only move along the streets. Each street can be represented as a straight line 
     * defined by the x = n or y = n formula, where n is an integer.
     * 
     * Example
     * For departure = [0.4, 1] and destination = [0.9, 3], the output should be perfectCity(departure, destination) = 2.7.
     * 0.6 + 2 + 0.1 = 2.7, which is the answer.
