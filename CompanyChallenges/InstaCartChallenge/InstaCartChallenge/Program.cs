    /* Our task is to implement an algorithm that determines whether shoppers should take the given order or not.
     * For each shopper you know their travel speed, distance to the store and the estimated amount of time they will spend there. 
     * Figure out which of them can take the order, assuming it is known when the customer wants to receive the groceries and 
     * the distance between their house and the store.
     * Example
     * For order = [200, 20, 15] and shoppers = [[300, 40, 5], [600, 40, 10]], the output should be
     * delivery(order, shoppers) = [false, true].
